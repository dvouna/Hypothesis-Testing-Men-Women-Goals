Hypothesis Testing: Men vs Women Goals

Statistically exploring football goal-scoring trends between men and women using Python and hypothesis testing.

📊 Overview
This project investigates gender-based differences in football goal statistics by comparing whether men and women score differently on average. Using hypothesis testing, we determine whether the observed differences are statistically significant or due to chance.

🔍 Methodology
Data Preparation: Filtering and cleaning raw inputs for accuracy.

Exploratory Analysis: Generating insights through visualizations and statistics.

Hypothesis Testing: Applying a two-sample t-test for group comparison.

🛠️ Stack
Python 3.9+

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

📈 Results
The notebook walks you through EDA and hypothesis testing, culminating in a decision to reject or retain the null hypothesis based on p-values and test statistics.
